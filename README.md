## What is Passky?
Passky is simple password manager, which works on a zero trust architecture. That means only user will be able to decrypt his passwords. So users can safely store their passwords on any server. That means if a server on where all passwords are stored get hacked, hacker won't be able to decrypt passwords and data on this server will be useless for him.
